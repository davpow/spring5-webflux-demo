# Spring 5 Webflux Demo App

This repository is a modified copy of the project from https://github.com/reactor/head-first-reactive-with-spring-and-reactor[Head-First Reactive Workshop]

This project demonstrates how to create a simple Spring 5 Webflux Reactor Application. It shows how to work with Webflux Reactive Streams, Flux and Mono.

## Getting Started

1. Checkout the repo
2. Run the app as a SpringBoot app

## Endpoints

The supported endpoints are defined in the `QuoteRouter` class.

* `GET /streamquotes` endpoint fetch a continous stream of random quotes.
* `GET /fetchquotes` endpoint fetch a Flux of Quotes with random changes in Quotes prices on each invocation.
* `POST /search` endpoint fetch content for the specified stock symbols. 
** Once the app is running locally, you can POST to the `/search` endpoint using:
** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/search -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"symbols": [ "AAPL","FB"],"content_types" : ["quote"]}'`
** Valid content_types are `quote,news,chart`
** NOTE: The `/search` endpoint makes a call out to a 3rd party API to get the stock quotes (This demo usage of Spring Reactive `WebClient` API).
